# raspberry_pi_temp_humidity_tracking
Uses a raspberry pi and a variety of sensors. Currently suing a Si 7021 or a AHT 20  sensor to read temp and humidity store in a local sqlite. in addition it will run a small html server so a time vs temp/humidity graph can be displayed
default preference read interaval is 15 minutes r_time
